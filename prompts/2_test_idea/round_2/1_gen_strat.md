title: >-
  Ontology-Grounded Semantic Unification with MDL-Based Pruning for Neuro-Symbolic Text-to-FOL Translation
hypothesis: >-
  By combining OpenCyc taxonomic path-based semantic similarity with neural embeddings to create a hybrid fuzzy unification
  operator in Prolog, and using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with ontological type constraints to prune
  extracted FOL clauses, we can significantly improve the accuracy and auditability of neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation
  pipelines while reducing hallucination rates compared to pure neural or pure symbolic approaches.
motivation: >-
  Current neuro-symbolic approaches to text-to-FOL translation suffer from three key limitations: (1) Pure embedding-based
  fuzzy unification lacks formal grounding in taxonomic knowledge, leading to semantically implausible unifications; (2) Extracted
  FOL clauses are not pruned for relevance and consistency, leading to bloated knowledge bases; (3) Reasoning traces lack
  explicit links to ontological concepts, reducing auditability. This work addresses all three by introducing a novel neuro-symbolic
  pipeline that uses OpenCyc's upper ontology to ground the fuzzy unification process and prune extracted clauses.
assumptions:
- >-
  OpenCyc's taxonomic hierarchy provides meaningful semantic similarity scores that can complement neural embedding similarity
  for fuzzy unification
- >-
  The MDL principle can be effectively combined with ontological type constraints to prune irrelevant or inconsistent FOL
  clauses
- >-
  Hybrid fuzzy unification (combining path-based taxonomy similarity with embedding similarity) will outperform either approach
  alone for natural language reasoning tasks
- >-
  The pipeline can run on commodity hardware with SWI-Prolog and local LLM inference within reasonable time constraints
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline that: (a) Uses an LLM to translate text to FOL clauses, (b) Validates type constraints
  using OpenCyc taxonomy, (c) Performs fuzzy unification using hybrid similarity (path-based + embedding), (d) Prunes clauses
  using MDL with type constraints. 2. Evaluate on RuleTaker and CLUTRR datasets. 3. Compare against baselines: pure neural
  (CoT prompting), pure symbolic (exact unification Prolog), and existing neuro-symbolic approaches (NLProlog, CLOVER). 4.
  Measure: (i) Precision/recall of atomic fact extraction, (ii) Multi-hop reasoning accuracy, (iii) Hallucination rate reduction,
  (iv) Trace-graph auditability.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) The hybrid ontology-grounded fuzzy unification achieves >10% higher accuracy on multi-hop
  reasoning tasks compared to embedding-only or path-only unification; (2) MDL-based pruning with type constraints reduces
  the number of extracted clauses by >30% while maintaining >95% of reasoning accuracy; (3) The pipeline reduces hallucination
  rate by >25% compared to raw LLM generation (CoT prompting); (4) Human evaluators can successfully audit reasoning traces
  and identify error sources using the generated trace-graphs with ontological links.
related_works:
- >-
  NLProlog (Weber et al., ACL 2019) - Uses weak unification with embeddings for question answering, but does NOT incorporate
  ontological taxonomy for path-based similarity or MDL-based pruning. Our work adds ontology-grounded semantic similarity
  and clause pruning.
- >-
  CLOVER (Ryu et al., arXiv 2410.08047) - Compositional FOL translation with SAT-based verification, but uses exact unification
  and does NOT incorporate fuzzy unification with ontologies. Our work introduces hybrid fuzzy unification grounded in OpenCyc.
- >-
  Embeddings as Probabilistic Equivalence (Maene & Tsamoura, NeurIPS 2025) - Uses embeddings for equivalence in logic programs,
  but does NOT use ontological taxonomies for grounding. Our work combines embeddings with path-based ontology similarity.
- >-
  MML for ILP (Sharma et al., arXiv 2508.06230) - Uses minimum message length for inductive logic programming, but does NOT
  apply MDL to prune LLM-generated clauses with type constraints. Our work applies MDL pruning in a neuro-symbolic translation
  context.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis draws inspiration from three cross-field connections: (1) INFORMATION THEORY: The MDL principle from model
  selection theory applied to prune FOL clauses based on description length + ontological type constraints; (2) COMPUTATIONAL
  LINGUISTICS: Hybrid semantic similarity measures that combine path-based taxonomy similarity (from ontology research) with
  neural embedding similarity (from NLP) for more robust fuzzy unification; (3) CONTROL THEORY: The feedback loop concept
  where Prolog execution results (success/failure of proofs) provide feedback to the LLM for iterative refinement of FOL translations.
terms:
- term: Fuzzy Unification
  definition: >-
    A relaxation of Prolog's exact unification that allows symbols to match if they are 'semantically similar' (above a threshold)
    rather than syntactically identical, enabling reasoning over noisy or variably-expressed natural language facts.
- term: Ontology-Grounded Semantic Similarity
  definition: >-
    A hybrid similarity measure that combines (a) path-based similarity from ontological taxonomies (e.g., shortest path in
    OpenCyc IS-A hierarchy) with (b) neural embedding cosine similarity, to provide formally grounded semantic matching for
    fuzzy unification.
- term: Minimum Description Length (MDL) Pruning
  definition: >-
    A model selection principle that prunes extracted FOL clauses by balancing the complexity of the clause set (description
    length) against its coverage of the facts, augmented with ontological type constraints to penalize semantically implausible
    clauses.
- term: Trace-Graph
  definition: >-
    A human-auditable proof tree showing each reasoning step (unification, rule application, ontological similarity score)
    with explicit links to the source text and ontological concepts used, enabling transparent debugging of neuro-symbolic
    reasoning.
- term: OpenCyc
  definition: >-
    An open-source upper ontology containing ~47,000 terms and ~306,000 assertions defining common-sense concepts and their
    taxonomic relationships, used here to provide type constraints and semantic similarity scores for FOL translation.
summary: >-
  We propose a neuro-symbolic pipeline that uses OpenCyc's taxonomic knowledge to ground fuzzy unification in Prolog (combining
  path-based and embedding similarity) and applies MDL-based pruning with type constraints to extracted FOL clauses, enabling
  more accurate, auditable, and hallucination-resistant text-to-logic translation.

id: gen_strat_1_idx1
title: Foundation Building for Neuro-Symbolic FOL Translation
objective: >-
  Establish core components for ontology-grounded fuzzy unification pipeline through research, dataset acquisition, and baseline
  implementation
rationale: >-
  As iteration 1 of 2, we must lay the groundwork: research OpenCyc integration and MDL pruning methods, acquire benchmark
  datasets (RuleTaker, CLUTRR), and implement a baseline LLM-to-FOL translator for performance comparison. This foundation
  enables iteration 2 to focus on implementing the novel hybrid fuzzy unification and MDL pruning components.
artifact_directions:
- id: research_iter1_dir1
  type: research
  objective: >-
    Investigate OpenCyc taxonomy access, hybrid semantic similarity measures, and MDL-based FOL clause pruning
  approach: >-
    Conduct comprehensive web research on: (1) OpenCyc ontology structure, file formats, and query methods (REST API, RDF,
    OWL), (2) Path-based semantic similarity measures in taxonomies (Wu-Palmer, Leacock-Chodorow, shortest path length), (3)
    Combining path-based and embedding-based similarity for hybrid measures, (4) MDL principle applications in logic programming
    for clause pruning, (5) Related work analysis: NLProlog's weak unification, CLOVER's SAT-based verification, and recent
    neuro-symbolic approaches. Synthesize into actionable implementation report with code examples and API references.
  depends_on: []
- id: dataset_iter1_dir2
  type: dataset
  objective: >-
    Acquire and standardize RuleTaker and CLUTRR datasets for evaluating text-to-FOL translation and multi-hop reasoning
  approach: >-
    Search for and download: (1) RuleTaker dataset (from AllenNLP or official GitHub - https://allenai.org/data/ruletaker)
    containing natural language facts and queries with varying complexity, (2) CLUTRR dataset (from HuggingFace datasets -
    clueai/CLUTRR or GitHub) containing multi-hop reasoning chains. Parse and convert to unified JSON schema: {id, context,
    query, answer, supporting_facts, depth, metadata}. Create full/mini/preview splits (full for final eval, mini for dev,
    preview for quick checks). Validate with aii-json schema validation. Include dataset statistics and sample visualization.
    This provides the evaluation benchmark for measuring precision/recall of fact extraction and multi-hop reasoning accuracy.
  depends_on: []
- id: experiment_iter1_dir3
  type: experiment
  objective: >-
    Implement baseline LLM-based text-to-FOL translation pipeline with basic Prolog reasoning
  approach: >-
    Develop a Python pipeline that: (1) Uses OpenRouter API to call LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, or Llama) with structured prompts
    to translate text passages (children's stories or short articles ~3000 chars) into FOL clauses in Prolog syntax, (2) Loads
    generated clauses into SWI-Prolog via subprocess (calling swipl -g 'consult(file), query'), (3) Executes queries against
    the knowledge base and extracts proof traces, (4) Evaluates on synthetic test cases or downloaded datasets (fallback to
    synthetic if dataset not yet available - use simple family relationships or animal facts). Metrics: precision/recall of
    extracted atomic facts vs ground truth, reasoning accuracy on queries, hallucination rate (plausible-sounding but incorrect
    facts). Save results to method_out.json with detailed trace logs. This establishes baseline performance for iteration
    2 comparison.
  depends_on: []
expected_outcome: >-
  After iteration 1 completion: (1) Research report detailing OpenCyc integration approach, hybrid similarity measure design,
  and MDL pruning methodology with actionable implementation steps; (2) Standardized RuleTaker + CLUTRR datasets in unified
  JSON format with train/val/test splits and data exploration report; (3) Working baseline LLM-to-FOL pipeline with initial
  performance metrics on fact extraction (establishing baseline precision/recall) and reasoning accuracy (establishing baseline
  for multi-hop tasks). This foundation enables iteration 2 to implement the novel contributions: hybrid fuzzy unification
  with OpenCyc grounding and MDL-based clause pruning.
summary: >-
  Lay the foundation for the neuro-symbolic FOL translation pipeline by researching OpenCyc integration and MDL pruning, acquiring
  benchmark datasets (RuleTaker, CLUTRR), and implementing a baseline LLM-to-FOL translator for performance comparison.

<dependency_rules>
- depends_on is a list of objects {id, label} — each entry references an existing artifact and tags how it is being used
- "id" can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts> — never IDs you are proposing (all new artifacts run in parallel)
- "label" is a SHORT free-text type label (a word or two, NOT a sentence) describing what role the dep plays — e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends", "supersedes". Required on every dep.
- Setting depends_on provides the dependency's out_dependency_files to your artifact at execution time
- If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use empty depends_on
- New artifact IDs are assigned by the system after submission — do not invent IDs for your proposed artifacts

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

  OpenCyc Integration and Hybrid Semantic Similarity for Neuro-Symbolic FOL Translation
summary: >-
  Comprehensive research on OpenCyc ontology access methods (RDF/OWL parsing via rdflib or SWI-Prolog semweb), hybrid semantic
  similarity measures combining Wu-Palmer path-based similarity with Sentence-BERT embeddings (recommended weights α=0.6,
  β=0.4), MDL-based clause pruning with ontological type constraints from OpenCyc, and analysis of related work (NLProlog's
  weak unification without ontological grounding, CLOVER's exact unification without fuzzy matching). Provides implementation
  roadmap with dependencies (rdflib, sentence-transformers, SWI-Prolog, janus/pyswip), pseudocode for fuzzy unification predicate
  in Prolog, MDL score computation formula, and failure mitigation strategies (WordNet fallback if OpenCyc unavailable, adaptive
  MDL threshold). Identifies critical gaps in related work: no ontological grounding, no MDL pruning, no type constraints.
  Confidence levels: High for established methods (MDL principle, Wu-Palmer similarity, Prolog unification), Medium for implementation
  details requiring empirical validation (optimal hybrid weights, actual MDL pruning effectiveness).

title: Neuro-Symbolic Translation Pipeline for Text-to-Logic Conversion
summary: >-
  This artifact implements a neuro-symbolic translation pipeline that converts unstructured textual content into formal first-order
  logic representations. The pipeline combines neural methods (LLMs) for semantic translation with symbolic methods (logic
  programming) for validation and reasoning. The implementation includes: (1) A text-to-logic translation function that extracts
  logical relationships from natural language text, (2) A simplified neuro-symbolic pipeline that demonstrates the integration
  of neural and symbolic approaches, (3) Baseline comparisons using standard logical reasoning patterns, (4) Output in exp_gen_sol_out.json
  schema format with metadata including confidence scores and reasoning traces. The system processes 5 logical reasoning samples,
  converting text like 'Alice is a parent of Bob' into Prolog-style predicates like 'parent(alice, bob)'. The output includes
  both the neuro-symbolic method's predictions and baseline comparisons, enabling evaluation of the hybrid approach against
  traditional methods. The implementation is designed to be extensible for integration with actual LLMs via OpenRouter and
  Prolog interpreters for production use.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-21 15:19:04 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured
textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids'
stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output
must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner
(like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology,
concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate.
Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the
substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming,
inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning,
LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs,
reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters)
and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine
an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text
to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic
interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the
integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary
background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM
should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy
unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict
symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline
against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought
prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker,
CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from
the original document, and (ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact
extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit
document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning
steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short,
professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on
commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction
in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with
EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy)
as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid
purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning
traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid
method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes
hallucinations.

title: >-
  Ontology-Grounded Semantic Unification with MDL-Based Pruning for Neuro-Symbolic Text-to-FOL Translation
hypothesis: >-
  By combining OpenCyc taxonomic path-based semantic similarity with neural embeddings to create a hybrid fuzzy unification
  operator in Prolog, and using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with ontological type constraints to prune
  extracted FOL clauses, we can significantly improve the accuracy and auditability of neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation
  pipelines while reducing hallucination rates compared to pure neural or pure symbolic approaches.
motivation: >-
  Current neuro-symbolic approaches to text-to-FOL translation suffer from three key limitations: (1) Pure embedding-based
  fuzzy unification lacks formal grounding in taxonomic knowledge, leading to semantically implausible unifications; (2) Extracted
  FOL clauses are not pruned for relevance and consistency, leading to bloated knowledge bases; (3) Reasoning traces lack
  explicit links to ontological concepts, reducing auditability. This work addresses all three by introducing a novel neuro-symbolic
  pipeline that uses OpenCyc's upper ontology to ground the fuzzy unification process and prune extracted clauses.
assumptions:
- >-
  OpenCyc's taxonomic hierarchy provides meaningful semantic similarity scores that can complement neural embedding similarity
  for fuzzy unification
- >-
  The MDL principle can be effectively combined with ontological type constraints to prune irrelevant or inconsistent FOL
  clauses
- >-
  Hybrid fuzzy unification (combining path-based taxonomy similarity with embedding similarity) will outperform either approach
  alone for natural language reasoning tasks
- >-
  The pipeline can run on commodity hardware with SWI-Prolog and local LLM inference within reasonable time constraints
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline that: (a) Uses an LLM to translate text to FOL clauses, (b) Validates type constraints
  using OpenCyc taxonomy, (c) Performs fuzzy unification using hybrid similarity (path-based + embedding), (d) Prunes clauses
  using MDL with type constraints. 2. Evaluate on RuleTaker and CLUTRR datasets. 3. Compare against baselines: pure neural
  (CoT prompting), pure symbolic (exact unification Prolog), and existing neuro-symbolic approaches (NLProlog, CLOVER). 4.
  Measure: (i) Precision/recall of atomic fact extraction, (ii) Multi-hop reasoning accuracy, (iii) Hallucination rate reduction,
  (iv) Trace-graph auditability.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) The hybrid ontology-grounded fuzzy unification achieves >10% higher accuracy on multi-hop
  reasoning tasks compared to embedding-only or path-only unification; (2) MDL-based pruning with type constraints reduces
  the number of extracted clauses by >30% while maintaining >95% of reasoning accuracy; (3) The pipeline reduces hallucination
  rate by >25% compared to raw LLM generation (CoT prompting); (4) Human evaluators can successfully audit reasoning traces
  and identify error sources using the generated trace-graphs with ontological links.
related_works:
- >-
  NLProlog (Weber et al., ACL 2019) - Uses weak unification with embeddings for question answering, but does NOT incorporate
  ontological taxonomy for path-based similarity or MDL-based pruning. Our work adds ontology-grounded semantic similarity
  and clause pruning.
- >-
  CLOVER (Ryu et al., arXiv 2410.08047) - Compositional FOL translation with SAT-based verification, but uses exact unification
  and does NOT incorporate fuzzy unification with ontologies. Our work introduces hybrid fuzzy unification grounded in OpenCyc.
- >-
  Embeddings as Probabilistic Equivalence (Maene & Tsamoura, NeurIPS 2025) - Uses embeddings for equivalence in logic programs,
  but does NOT use ontological taxonomies for grounding. Our work combines embeddings with path-based ontology similarity.
- >-
  MML for ILP (Sharma et al., arXiv 2508.06230) - Uses minimum message length for inductive logic programming, but does NOT
  apply MDL to prune LLM-generated clauses with type constraints. Our work applies MDL pruning in a neuro-symbolic translation
  context.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis draws inspiration from three cross-field connections: (1) INFORMATION THEORY: The MDL principle from model
  selection theory applied to prune FOL clauses based on description length + ontological type constraints; (2) COMPUTATIONAL
  LINGUISTICS: Hybrid semantic similarity measures that combine path-based taxonomy similarity (from ontology research) with
  neural embedding similarity (from NLP) for more robust fuzzy unification; (3) CONTROL THEORY: The feedback loop concept
  where Prolog execution results (success/failure of proofs) provide feedback to the LLM for iterative refinement of FOL translations.
terms:
- term: Fuzzy Unification
  definition: >-
    A relaxation of Prolog's exact unification that allows symbols to match if they are 'semantically similar' (above a threshold)
    rather than syntactically identical, enabling reasoning over noisy or variably-expressed natural language facts.
- term: Ontology-Grounded Semantic Similarity
  definition: >-
    A hybrid similarity measure that combines (a) path-based similarity from ontological taxonomies (e.g., shortest path in
    OpenCyc IS-A hierarchy) with (b) neural embedding cosine similarity, to provide formally grounded semantic matching for
    fuzzy unification.
- term: Minimum Description Length (MDL) Pruning
  definition: >-
    A model selection principle that prunes extracted FOL clauses by balancing the complexity of the clause set (description
    length) against its coverage of the facts, augmented with ontological type constraints to penalize semantically implausible
    clauses.
- term: Trace-Graph
  definition: >-
    A human-auditable proof tree showing each reasoning step (unification, rule application, ontological similarity score)
    with explicit links to the source text and ontological concepts used, enabling transparent debugging of neuro-symbolic
    reasoning.
- term: OpenCyc
  definition: >-
    An open-source upper ontology containing ~47,000 terms and ~306,000 assertions defining common-sense concepts and their
    taxonomic relationships, used here to provide type constraints and semantic similarity scores for FOL translation.
summary: >-
  We propose a neuro-symbolic pipeline that uses OpenCyc's taxonomic knowledge to ground fuzzy unification in Prolog (combining
  path-based and embedding similarity) and applies MDL-based pruning with type constraints to extracted FOL clauses, enabling
  more accurate, auditable, and hallucination-resistant text-to-logic translation.

title: Foundation Building for Neuro-Symbolic FOL Translation
objective: >-
  Establish core components for ontology-grounded fuzzy unification pipeline through research, dataset acquisition, and baseline
  implementation
rationale: >-
  As iteration 1 of 2, we must lay the groundwork: research OpenCyc integration and MDL pruning methods, acquire benchmark
  datasets (RuleTaker, CLUTRR), and implement a baseline LLM-to-FOL translator for performance comparison. This foundation
  enables iteration 2 to focus on implementing the novel hybrid fuzzy unification and MDL pruning components.
artifact_directions:
- id: research_iter1_dir1
  type: research
  objective: >-
    Investigate OpenCyc taxonomy access, hybrid semantic similarity measures, and MDL-based FOL clause pruning
  approach: >-
    Conduct comprehensive web research on: (1) OpenCyc ontology structure, file formats, and query methods (REST API, RDF,
    OWL), (2) Path-based semantic similarity measures in taxonomies (Wu-Palmer, Leacock-Chodorow, shortest path length), (3)
    Combining path-based and embedding-based similarity for hybrid measures, (4) MDL principle applications in logic programming
    for clause pruning, (5) Related work analysis: NLProlog's weak unification, CLOVER's SAT-based verification, and recent
    neuro-symbolic approaches. Synthesize into actionable implementation report with code examples and API references.

  objective: >-
    Acquire and standardize RuleTaker and CLUTRR datasets for evaluating text-to-FOL translation and multi-hop reasoning
  approach: >-
    Search for and download: (1) RuleTaker dataset (from AllenNLP or official GitHub - https://allenai.org/data/ruletaker)
    containing natural language facts and queries with varying complexity, (2) CLUTRR dataset (from HuggingFace datasets -
    clueai/CLUTRR or GitHub) containing multi-hop reasoning chains. Parse and convert to unified JSON schema: {id, context,
    query, answer, supporting_facts, depth, metadata}. Create full/mini/preview splits (full for final eval, mini for dev,
    preview for quick checks). Validate with aii-json schema validation. Include dataset statistics and sample visualization.
    This provides the evaluation benchmark for measuring precision/recall of fact extraction and multi-hop reasoning accuracy.
  depends_on: []
- id: experiment_iter1_dir3
  type: experiment
  objective: >-
    Implement baseline LLM-based text-to-FOL translation pipeline with basic Prolog reasoning
  approach: >-
    Develop a Python pipeline that: (1) Uses OpenRouter API to call LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, or Llama) with structured prompts
    to translate text passages (children's stories or short articles ~3000 chars) into FOL clauses in Prolog syntax, (2) Loads
    generated clauses into SWI-Prolog via subprocess (calling swipl -g 'consult(file), query'), (3) Executes queries against
    the knowledge base and extracts proof traces, (4) Evaluates on synthetic test cases or downloaded datasets (fallback to
    synthetic if dataset not yet available - use simple family relationships or animal facts). Metrics: precision/recall of
    extracted atomic facts vs ground truth, reasoning accuracy on queries, hallucination rate (plausible-sounding but incorrect
    facts). Save results to method_out.json with detailed trace logs. This establishes baseline performance for iteration
    2 comparison.
  depends_on: []
expected_outcome: >-
  After iteration 1 completion: (1) Research report detailing OpenCyc integration approach, hybrid similarity measure design,
  and MDL pruning methodology with actionable implementation steps; (2) Standardized RuleTaker + CLUTRR datasets in unified
  JSON format with train/val/test splits and data exploration report; (3) Working baseline LLM-to-FOL pipeline with initial
  performance metrics on fact extraction (establishing baseline precision/recall) and reasoning accuracy (establishing baseline
  for multi-hop tasks). This foundation enables iteration 2 to implement the novel contributions: hybrid fuzzy unification
  with OpenCyc grounding and MDL-based clause pruning.
summary: >-
  Lay the foundation for the neuro-symbolic FOL translation pipeline by researching OpenCyc integration and MDL pruning, acquiring
  benchmark datasets (RuleTaker, CLUTRR), and implementing a baseline LLM-to-FOL translator for performance comparison.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

  Comprehensive research on OpenCyc ontology access methods (RDF/OWL parsing via rdflib or SWI-Prolog semweb), hybrid semantic
  similarity measures combining Wu-Palmer path-based similarity with Sentence-BERT embeddings (recommended weights α=0.6,
  β=0.4), MDL-based clause pruning with ontological type constraints from OpenCyc, and analysis of related work (NLProlog's

  in Prolog, MDL score computation formula, and failure mitigation strategies (WordNet fallback if OpenCyc unavailable, adaptive
  MDL threshold). Identifies critical gaps in related work: no ontological grounding, no MDL pruning, no type constraints.
  Confidence levels: High for established methods (MDL principle, Wu-Palmer similarity, Prolog unification), Medium for implementation

title: Neuro-Symbolic Translation Pipeline for Text-to-Logic Conversion
summary: >-
  This artifact implements a neuro-symbolic translation pipeline that converts unstructured textual content into formal first-order
  logic representations. The pipeline combines neural methods (LLMs) for semantic translation with symbolic methods (logic
  programming) for validation and reasoning. The implementation includes: (1) A text-to-logic translation function that extracts
  logical relationships from natural language text, (2) A simplified neuro-symbolic pipeline that demonstrates the integration
  of neural and symbolic approaches, (3) Baseline comparisons using standard logical reasoning patterns, (4) Output in exp_gen_sol_out.json
  schema format with metadata including confidence scores and reasoning traces. The system processes 5 logical reasoning samples,
  converting text like 'Alice is a parent of Bob' into Prolog-style predicates like 'parent(alice, bob)'. The output includes
  both the neuro-symbolic method's predictions and baseline comparisons, enabling evaluation of the hybrid approach against
  traditional methods. The implementation is designed to be extensible for integration with actual LLMs via OpenRouter and
  Prolog interpreters for production use.

### [4] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-21 15:22:03 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured
textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids'
stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output
must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner
(like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology,
concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate.
Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the
substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming,
inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning,
LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs,
reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters)
and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine
an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text
to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic
interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the
integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary
background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM
should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy
unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict
symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline
against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought
prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker,
CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from
the original document, and (ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact
extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit
document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning
steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short,
professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on
commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction
in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with
EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy)
as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid
purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning
traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid
method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes
hallucinations.

title: >-
  Ontology-Grounded Semantic Unification with MDL-Based Pruning for Neuro-Symbolic Text-to-FOL Translation
hypothesis: >-
  By combining OpenCyc taxonomic path-based semantic similarity with neural embeddings to create a hybrid fuzzy unification
  operator in Prolog, and using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with ontological type constraints to prune
  extracted FOL clauses, we can significantly improve the accuracy and auditability of neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation
  pipelines while reducing hallucination rates compared to pure neural or pure symbolic approaches.
motivation: >-
  Current neuro-symbolic approaches to text-to-FOL translation suffer from three key limitations: (1) Pure embedding-based
  fuzzy unification lacks formal grounding in taxonomic knowledge, leading to semantically implausible unifications; (2) Extracted
  FOL clauses are not pruned for relevance and consistency, leading to bloated knowledge bases; (3) Reasoning traces lack
  explicit links to ontological concepts, reducing auditability. This work addresses all three by introducing a novel neuro-symbolic
  pipeline that uses OpenCyc's upper ontology to ground the fuzzy unification process and prune extracted clauses.
assumptions:
- >-
  OpenCyc's taxonomic hierarchy provides meaningful semantic similarity scores that can complement neural embedding similarity
  for fuzzy unification
- >-
  The MDL principle can be effectively combined with ontological type constraints to prune irrelevant or inconsistent FOL
  clauses
- >-
  Hybrid fuzzy unification (combining path-based taxonomy similarity with embedding similarity) will outperform either approach
  alone for natural language reasoning tasks
- >-
  The pipeline can run on commodity hardware with SWI-Prolog and local LLM inference within reasonable time constraints
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline that: (a) Uses an LLM to translate text to FOL clauses, (b) Validates type constraints
  using OpenCyc taxonomy, (c) Performs fuzzy unification using hybrid similarity (path-based + embedding), (d) Prunes clauses
  using MDL with type constraints. 2. Evaluate on RuleTaker and CLUTRR datasets. 3. Compare against baselines: pure neural
  (CoT prompting), pure symbolic (exact unification Prolog), and existing neuro-symbolic approaches (NLProlog, CLOVER). 4.
  Measure: (i) Precision/recall of atomic fact extraction, (ii) Multi-hop reasoning accuracy, (iii) Hallucination rate reduction,
  (iv) Trace-graph auditability.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) The hybrid ontology-grounded fuzzy unification achieves >10% higher accuracy on multi-hop
  reasoning tasks compared to embedding-only or path-only unification; (2) MDL-based pruning with type constraints reduces
  the number of extracted clauses by >30% while maintaining >95% of reasoning accuracy; (3) The pipeline reduces hallucination
  rate by >25% compared to raw LLM generation (CoT prompting); (4) Human evaluators can successfully audit reasoning traces
  and identify error sources using the generated trace-graphs with ontological links.
related_works:
- >-
  NLProlog (Weber et al., ACL 2019) - Uses weak unification with embeddings for question answering, but does NOT incorporate
  ontological taxonomy for path-based similarity or MDL-based pruning. Our work adds ontology-grounded semantic similarity
  and clause pruning.
- >-
  CLOVER (Ryu et al., arXiv 2410.08047) - Compositional FOL translation with SAT-based verification, but uses exact unification
  and does NOT incorporate fuzzy unification with ontologies. Our work introduces hybrid fuzzy unification grounded in OpenCyc.
- >-
  Embeddings as Probabilistic Equivalence (Maene & Tsamoura, NeurIPS 2025) - Uses embeddings for equivalence in logic programs,
  but does NOT use ontological taxonomies for grounding. Our work combines embeddings with path-based ontology similarity.
- >-
  MML for ILP (Sharma et al., arXiv 2508.06230) - Uses minimum message length for inductive logic programming, but does NOT
  apply MDL to prune LLM-generated clauses with type constraints. Our work applies MDL pruning in a neuro-symbolic translation
  context.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis draws inspiration from three cross-field connections: (1) INFORMATION THEORY: The MDL principle from model
  selection theory applied to prune FOL clauses based on description length + ontological type constraints; (2) COMPUTATIONAL
  LINGUISTICS: Hybrid semantic similarity measures that combine path-based taxonomy similarity (from ontology research) with
  neural embedding similarity (from NLP) for more robust fuzzy unification; (3) CONTROL THEORY: The feedback loop concept
  where Prolog execution results (success/failure of proofs) provide feedback to the LLM for iterative refinement of FOL translations.
terms:
- term: Fuzzy Unification
  definition: >-
    A relaxation of Prolog's exact unification that allows symbols to match if they are 'semantically similar' (above a threshold)
    rather than syntactically identical, enabling reasoning over noisy or variably-expressed natural language facts.
- term: Ontology-Grounded Semantic Similarity
  definition: >-
    A hybrid similarity measure that combines (a) path-based similarity from ontological taxonomies (e.g., shortest path in
    OpenCyc IS-A hierarchy) with (b) neural embedding cosine similarity, to provide formally grounded semantic matching for
    fuzzy unification.
- term: Minimum Description Length (MDL) Pruning
  definition: >-
    A model selection principle that prunes extracted FOL clauses by balancing the complexity of the clause set (description
    length) against its coverage of the facts, augmented with ontological type constraints to penalize semantically implausible
    clauses.
- term: Trace-Graph
  definition: >-
    A human-auditable proof tree showing each reasoning step (unification, rule application, ontological similarity score)
    with explicit links to the source text and ontological concepts used, enabling transparent debugging of neuro-symbolic
    reasoning.
- term: OpenCyc
  definition: >-
    An open-source upper ontology containing ~47,000 terms and ~306,000 assertions defining common-sense concepts and their
    taxonomic relationships, used here to provide type constraints and semantic similarity scores for FOL translation.
summary: >-
  We propose a neuro-symbolic pipeline that uses OpenCyc's taxonomic knowledge to ground fuzzy unification in Prolog (combining
  path-based and embedding similarity) and applies MDL-based pruning with type constraints to extracted FOL clauses, enabling
  more accurate, auditable, and hallucination-resistant text-to-logic translation.

  As iteration 1 of 2, we must lay the groundwork: research OpenCyc integration and MDL pruning methods, acquire benchmark
  datasets (RuleTaker, CLUTRR), and implement a baseline LLM-to-FOL translator for performance comparison. This foundation
  enables iteration 2 to focus on implementing the novel hybrid fuzzy unification and MDL pruning components.

    Search for and download: (1) RuleTaker dataset (from AllenNLP or official GitHub - https://allenai.org/data/ruletaker)
    containing natural language facts and queries with varying complexity, (2) CLUTRR dataset (from HuggingFace datasets -
    clueai/CLUTRR or GitHub) containing multi-hop reasoning chains. Parse and convert to unified JSON schema: {id, context,
    query, answer, supporting_facts, depth, metadata}. Create full/mini/preview splits (full for final eval, mini for dev,

    Implement baseline LLM-based text-to-FOL translation pipeline with basic Prolog reasoning
  approach: >-
    Develop a Python pipeline that: (1) Uses OpenRouter API to call LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, or Llama) with structured prompts
    to translate text passages (children's stories or short articles ~3000 chars) into FOL clauses in Prolog syntax, (2) Loads
    generated clauses into SWI-Prolog via subprocess (calling swipl -g 'consult(file), query'), (3) Executes queries against
    the knowledge base and extracts proof traces, (4) Evaluates on synthetic test cases or downloaded datasets (fallback to
    synthetic if dataset not yet available - use simple family relationships or animal facts). Metrics: precision/recall of
    extracted atomic facts vs ground truth, reasoning accuracy on queries, hallucination rate (plausible-sounding but incorrect
    facts). Save results to method_out.json with detailed trace logs. This establishes baseline performance for iteration
    2 comparison.
  depends_on: []
expected_outcome: >-
  After iteration 1 completion: (1) Research report detailing OpenCyc integration approach, hybrid similarity measure design,
  and MDL pruning methodology with actionable implementation steps; (2) Standardized RuleTaker + CLUTRR datasets in unified
  JSON format with train/val/test splits and data exploration report; (3) Working baseline LLM-to-FOL pipeline with initial
  performance metrics on fact extraction (establishing baseline precision/recall) and reasoning accuracy (establishing baseline
  for multi-hop tasks). This foundation enables iteration 2 to implement the novel contributions: hybrid fuzzy unification
  with OpenCyc grounding and MDL-based clause pruning.
summary: >-
  Lay the foundation for the neuro-symbolic FOL translation pipeline by researching OpenCyc integration and MDL pruning, acquiring
  benchmark datasets (RuleTaker, CLUTRR), and implementing a baseline LLM-to-FOL translator for performance comparison.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

title: Neuro-Symbolic Translation Pipeline for Text-to-Logic Conversion
summary: >-
  This artifact implements a neuro-symbolic translation pipeline that converts unstructured textual content into formal first-order
  logic representations. The pipeline combines neural methods (LLMs) for semantic translation with symbolic methods (logic
  programming) for validation and reasoning. The implementation includes: (1) A text-to-logic translation function that extracts
  logical relationships from natural language text, (2) A simplified neuro-symbolic pipeline that demonstrates the integration
  of neural and symbolic approaches, (3) Baseline comparisons using standard logical reasoning patterns, (4) Output in exp_gen_sol_out.json
  schema format with metadata including confidence scores and reasoning traces. The system processes 5 logical reasoning samples,
  converting text like 'Alice is a parent of Bob' into Prolog-style predicates like 'parent(alice, bob)'. The output includes
  both the neuro-symbolic method's predictions and baseline comparisons, enabling evaluation of the hybrid approach against
  traditional methods. The implementation is designed to be extensible for integration with actual LLMs via OpenRouter and
  Prolog interpreters for production use.

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured
textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids'
stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output
must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner
(like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology,
concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate.
Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the
substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming,
inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning,
LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs,
reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters)
and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine
an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text
to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic
interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the
integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary
background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM
should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy
unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict
symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline
against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought
prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker,
CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from
the original document, and (ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact
extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit
document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning
steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short,
professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on
commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction
in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with
EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy)
as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid
purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning
traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid
method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes
hallucinations.
